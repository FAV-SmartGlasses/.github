# 🛠️ OptiForge

Welcome to **OptiForge** - a student-led initiative reimagining immersive technology. We are a passionate group of students building an **AR & VR headset** powered by the **Raspberry Pi 5**.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

To make extended reality (XR) headset **affordable, modular, and open**, enabling students, hobbyists, and developers around the world to explore and innovate in AR/VR without the walled gardens of traditional headsets.

---

## 🔍 What We’re Building

A lightweight, customizable **AR/VR headset platform** that:
- 🧠 Runs on **Raspberry Pi 5**
- 🕶️ Supports **both AR (transparent mode)** and **VR (fully immersive mode)**
- 🎮 Offers **low-latency tracking** and **real-time rendering**
- 🔌 Includes modular support for sensors: **IMU, cameras, depth sensors,** and **hand tracking**
- 🔓 Is fully **open-source**

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- **9DoF positional tracking**: Built with lightweight IMU + SLAM capabilities
- **Expandable**: GPIO access allows creative hardware integrations
- **Optimized for Pi5**: Leveraging multi-core CPU + GPU for real-time performance
- **Cheap**: Costs only about 400 dollars
